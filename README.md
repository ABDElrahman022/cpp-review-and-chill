# C++ Pattern & Logic Playground ðŸ§ âœ¨

This repository is a collection of small C++ programs and logic snippets I write when:

- Reviewing basic concepts  
- Exploring pattern printing  
- Testing ideas and algorithms  
- Or simply coding while bored  

It currently includes:

âœ… Star pattern printing  
âœ… Inverted pyramids  
âœ… Hollow (outlined) pyramids  
âœ… Nested loops logic  
âœ… Multiple versions of the same output using `for` and `while`  
âœ… Logic-based mini games (like a simple text-based XO)  

> And more to come...

## ðŸ’¡ Why this repo?

To keep a clean, version-controlled space for trying small ideas in C++ â€“ especially useful during boredom, revision, or deep thinking ðŸ§©.

## ðŸŽ® Logic-based Mini Games

In addition to pattern printing, this repo includes small logic-based mini games â€“ like a simple **text-based Tic Tac Toe (XO)**.

The game lets two players take turns entering coordinates on a 3x3 grid, with logic for input validation and win-checking. Itâ€™s a fun and practical way to revise:

- 2D arrays  
- Functions & modular logic  
- Conditional checks  
- Turn-based game flow  

These games are intentionally kept basic to focus on the logic and strengthen core understanding.
