# C++ Pattern & Logic Playground 🧠✨

This repository is a collection of small C++ programs and logic snippets I write when:

- Reviewing basic concepts  
- Exploring pattern printing  
- Testing ideas and algorithms  
- Or simply coding while bored  

It currently includes:

✅ Star pattern printing  
✅ Inverted pyramids  
✅ Hollow (outlined) pyramids  
✅ Nested loops logic  
✅ Multiple versions of the same output using `for` and `while`  
✅ Logic-based mini games (like a simple text-based XO)  
✅ Basic Student Affairs Logic using `struct` and `reference-based functions`  
✅ Simple Pizza Restaurant (OOP vs Procedural comparison) 🍕

> And more to come...
