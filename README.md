# C++ Pattern & Logic Playground ðŸ§ âœ¨

This repository is a collection of small C++ programs and logic snippets I write when:

- Reviewing basic concepts
- Exploring pattern printing (stars, triangles, pyramids, etc.)
- Testing ideas and algorithms
- Or simply coding while bored

It currently includes:

âœ… Star pattern printing  
âœ… Inverted pyramids  
âœ… Nested loops logic  
âœ… Multiple versions of the same output using `for` and `while`  

> And more to come...
